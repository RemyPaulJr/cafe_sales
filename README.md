# ☕ Café Sales Analytics Project

## 📌 Objective
Analyze messy café sales data from a local business to clean, transform, and extract insights for better operational and product decisions.

## 👨‍💼 Business Context
> As told by the café owner:

> Hi Remy,  
> Thanks for helping me out with this mess of a sales spreadsheet...  
> I’ve been running this café for the past 2 years, and while the business is doing okay, I honestly don’t know what’s working and what’s not.
> I exported some sales data from my POS system, but it’s all over the place. Some items are listed in different ways (like “latte” vs. “Laté”), and I think there are duplicates and maybe even errors in the quantities. It’s been too much to handle.

## 🧽 Data Cleaning Focus
- Fix inconsistent item names (e.g., “latte” vs. “Laté”)
- Parse dates and timestamps
- Handle missing or duplicated transactions
- Identify and correct data entry errors (negative quantities, strange timestamps, etc.)

## 🔎 Key Business Questions
- What are our busiest days/hours?
- Which items generate the most revenue?
- Are there operational inefficiencies or refund issues?
